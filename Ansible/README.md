# Openshift Deployment Process
This folder contains the needed ansible files to deploy Openshift to the vmware environment using the IPI installer method. 

The dir `ocp_acm_managed_cluster_deployment` will install a managed cluster from a hub cluster by creating all the necessary yaml files and applying them.  

The dir `ocp_cluster_deployment_vmware` will install a generic OCP cluster in a vmware environment using IPI.
